The Dream of the Automobile (auto, gr.: self; mobil, lat.: movable) is several thousand years old. Already shortly after the invention of the wheel (approximately 4000 years before the Common Era) humans began to develop vehicles that could move independently of human or animal muscle power. The invention of the steam engine in 1768 by James Watt (English mechanic and inventor, 1736-1819), followed by Nicolaus Joseph Cugnot's construction of a three-wheeled vehicle with a steam-powered drive in 1769/70, marked the beginning of this development. This vehicle reached a top speed of 4 km/h and could transport loads up to 7 tons.

In 1801, Richard Trevithick (English inventor, 1771-1833) built the first practical steam-powered carriage for passenger transportation. In 1816, Georg Langenspenger (German coachbuilder in Munich, 1779-1847) invented the universal joint.

The development of the automobile gained momentum with the invention of the pneumatic tire by Robert William Thomson from Edinburgh in London in 1845. The first internal combustion engine was developed by Jean-Joseph Etienne Lenoir in 1860. In 1868, Siegfried Marcus (Austrian inventor, 1831-1891) constructed a four-stroke gasoline motor and drove a vehicle with it in 1875.

However, his invention did not gain widespread acceptance. Instead, the use of liquid fuel and the development of surface carburetors became more prevalent from 1875 onwards. In 1876, Nikolaus August Otto built a reliable four-stroke engine, and he received a patent for this design in 1877.

In 1882, Gottlieb Daimler (German engineer, 1834-1900) and Wilhelm Maybach (German constructor, 1846-1929) founded a company in Cannstatt to manufacture small gasoline engines. In 1883, Daimler received the first patents for a high-speed gasoline engine.

This engine was equipped with glow plug ignition and reached speeds of 500 to 900 revolutions per minute. The throttle control was achieved through rocker arms and valves. The motor output was approximately 0.36 kW.

In 1885, Daimler initially installed his motor in a single-seater (Fig. 1). In the same year, Maybach developed a carburetor with a float chamber. In 1885, Karl Benz (German engineer, 1844-1929) filed patents for the first automobile in the world.

In 1886, test drives began with this vehicle, which had a three-wheeled Benz motorcar with an engine having a displacement of 0.91 liters, a speed of 400 revolutions per minute, and an output of approximately 0.65 kW.

In 1886, Daimler presented his four-wheeled motor car, featuring an engine with a displacement of 0.46 liters and a speed of 600 revolutions per minute, which produced approximately 0.81 kW.

In 1892, Rudolf Diesel (German engineer, 1858-1913) received his first patent for a self-starting engine. In 1897, the first diesel engine was ready for production.

In 1889, the Dunlop company introduced the first pneumatic tire to market. In 1895, Dunlop equipped the first automobile with pneumatic tires.

The bearing of shafts was initially achieved through ball bearings, followed by the development of vehicles, with the first vehicles featuring single-joint suspension built and tested by Daimler-Benz in 1934, which marked the beginning of the development of the Volkswagen by Ferdinand Porsche (German automobile designer, 1875-1951), whose series production of the Beetle (Fig. 2) began after World War II, and more than 20 million vehicles were produced until 1981. In 1934, mass production of vehicles with self-supporting bodywork also began.

In 1902, Robert Bosch (German entrepreneur, 1861-1942) developed the first high-voltage magneto ignition, and in 1903 Henry Ford (American engineer, 1863-1947) founded the Ford Motor Company, which introduced flow production in automobile manufacturing in 1913. Between 1907 and 1926, a total of 15 million T-model vehicles were produced (Fig. 1), with daily production reaching 9,000 vehicles in 1925. The T-model had an engine displacement of 2.9 liters, a power output of 15.7 kW at 1,600 min-1, and was equipped with summer ignition and an alternating current generator.

Around 1920, the first hydraulic brake was installed, and testing of high-voltage ignition using induction coils (ignition coils) began; in 1924, the first diesel engine was installed in a truck, and in 1925, Bosch started producing battery ignition systems (single-function ignition). In 1927, Bosch introduced the diesel injection pump, and in 1928, Charles F. Kettering (American engineer, 1876-1956) designed a synchronized transmission.

Further developments include the beginning of the development of steel belt tires by Michelin in 1948, the construction of an aircraft-powered vehicle by Rover in England in 1950, the design of a rotary piston engine by Felix Wankel (German engineer, 1902-1988) in 1954, which became series-ready in 1964; the installation of the first electronic fuel injection system (D-Jetronic) in production vehicles in 1967, the introduction of seatbelts (front seats) in 1970, the installation of the Anti-Blocking System (ABS) in production vehicles in 1972, and the beginning of mass production for contactless transistor ignition systems in Germany in 1974.

The vehicle was equipped with Motronic (L-)tronic together with electronic timing-point adjustment - characteristic ignition in 1979; the introduction of all-wheel drive for passenger cars in 1982, the introduction of electronic carburetors and knock-and-load pressure regulation in 1983, the installation of airbags and seatbelt pretensioners in production vehicles in 1984, the introduction of exhaust gas catalysts with lambda sensor and unleaded fuel in Germany in 1985; the installation of electronically controlled diesel injection pumps, traction slip control (ASR), transmission control in 1985, the introduction of exhaust gas catalysts for passenger cars with diesel engines in 1990, the introduction of throttle valves and variable camshaft timing, the installation of diesel injection systems with pressures up to 1,500 bar, pump-distributor unit (PDE), pump-leakage distributor (PLD) in 1993.

The vehicle was equipped with electronic navigation systems in passenger cars in 1994; the introduction of the electronic stability program (ESP) in 1995, the installation of turbochargers with variable turbine geometry (VTG) in 1996, the installation of common rail fuel injection systems in diesel engines for passenger cars in 1997, and the development of gasoline direct injection to series-ready status in Germany in 2000.

The forces required for braking are generated by high-performance electric motors (Fig. 4). An electronic control unit regulates the individual electric motors electrically, taking into account signals from the electronic brake pedal and all sensor information from the dynamic control systems (e.g., ABS, ESP, ASR).

New engine developments aim to combine the advantages of Otto and diesel engines in a single Diesel-Otto motor. A variable compression ratio and full-variable valve timing enable the engine to operate in partial load mode according to the diesel operating principle and at full load according to the Otto engine's operating principle.

The motor features direct fuel injection and dual charging, offering low fuel consumption (Otto fuel) and reduced emissions. The pollutants can be converted using conventional three-way catalysts.

Networking electronic systems enables the driver to receive a wide range of important information at the right time. The connection of traffic announcements, parking information service messages, and vehicle navigation allows for intelligent route planning.

From data collected from vehicles in flowing traffic (e.g., position, speed, braking events, wiper function), an actual traffic profile is developed and made available to the driver. Severe accidents are recognized through sensor signals (crash sensors for airbag and seatbelt tensioner, wheel speed sensors, roll moment sensor, engine sensors).

Automatically, an emergency call is sent, the vehicle is located, rescue teams are alerted, and they are directed to the accident site.

2.2 Legal Requirements for the Operation of Vehicles on Public Roads and Plazas state that only vehicles approved by the traffic authority for public road use are permitted to be used on public roads and plazas. The approval is granted through the issuance of a permit, which confirms that the vehicle complies with the Road Traffic Licensing Ordinance (StVZO), and for series vehicles, the manufacturer receives a general operating permit (ABE) for the entire series. Individual vehicles or series vehicles that have undergone modifications receive an individual operating permit (EBE). Unauthorized modifications to vehicles result in the revocation of the general operating permit (ABE). Vehicles are only permitted to be used on public roads if the following legal requirements are met: The driver must possess a valid driver's license for the vehicle, and the vehicle must be insured and registered, as well as receive an official registration plate from the local licensing authority. If the vehicle complies with the general operating permit, a official inspection plaque will be affixed to the rear registration plate, and the vehicle logbook will feature an official stamp showing the inspection number of the report and the date of the next main inspection.

The exhaust emission test for vehicles with Otto engines (since first licensing in 1969) and diesel engines (since first licensing in 1977) has been integrated into the main inspection since January 1, 2010. The successful exhaust emission test will only be confirmed from January 1, 2010 onwards through the HU inspection plaque on the rear registration plate.

The vehicle owner must keep the driver's license, vehicle logbook, and exhaust emission test report with them. The driver's license is issued after passing a test for one or more types of vehicles (Table 1). Vehicles and trailers are subject to regular main inspections (HU), which ensure that the vehicle is roadworthy and safe to operate.

2.3 Vehicle components, systems, and parts describe the allocation of vehicle components into groups as shown in Table 2, while tasks for Chapters 1 and 2 ask when the steam engine was invented, who the inventor was, and what time period he lived in; when the first patent for a diesel motor was granted, who received it, and what year the continuous production process (Fließbandfertigung) began in the automotive industry.

Machines and equipment are technical systems, such as a tool machine, a vehicle, or its motor, that often have complex interdependencies and are difficult to overlook and understand. It is only through systematic consideration of their structure and functioning that it is possible to grasp their intricate relationships, aided by system technology, which enables the development of specific characteristics for all technical systems and the identification of correlations between them (system consideration). The goal of system consideration is to break down a technical system in such a way as to enable an overviewable representation and examination (analysis) of the technical system. Each technical system is self-contained and marked by its system boundary, which separates it from other technical systems and/or its environment (Fig. 1), often referred to as interfaces, for example, in computer science (see Chap. 14.4.2). Every technical system is characterized by input (input parameters, inputs) coming from outside the system boundary, processing of these inputs within the technical system, and output (output parameters, outputs) that leaves the system boundary and goes to the environment (EVA principle, see Chap. 14.1.4 and ⇥ TB: Chap. 2). In Fig. 1, the input, processing, and output (EVA principle) are simplified for the Otto motor. A technical system is connected with other systems and/or the environment through input and output parameters, where it stands in connection to other technical systems (e.g., engine to transmission), to humans (e.g., through operation, maintenance), and to the environment (e.g., through noise, emissions). The main functions of technical systems arise from the difference between input parameters and output parameters, with the conversion of these parameters being referred to as implementation. In technical systems, energy, matter, and information are implemented, where the implementation of these quantities takes center stage, and the implementation of these quantities is the primary function of the technical system, which fulfills its actual purpose for which it was developed. The primary function of a technical system can be divided into partial functions and fundamental functions (see Chap. 3.3.2), with the sum of these partial and fundamental functions being the primary function of the technical system, depending on what kind of primary function technical systems have, they are categorized as energy-converting, matter-converting, or information-converting systems.

--- Page 8 ---
Main functions of technical systems include energy conversion, material transformation, and information conversion, with energy conversion representing the transformation of one energy form into another, which in a combustion engine is achieved through the mixing and ignition of fuel-air mixtures in the cylinder chamber, resulting in an increase in pressure that acts on the piston and pushes it down, whereby a torque is transmitted to the crankshaft via connecting rod and crankpin, ultimately delivering mechanical energy. In contrast, chemical energy in the combustion engine is first converted into thermal energy and then into mechanical energy (Fig. 2), while material transformation encompasses shape change or transport of materials, as exemplified by the brake drum lathe, where the shape of the cast brake drum is altered through rotation to achieve the desired dimensions and tolerances through material transformation.

In the combustion engine, primary participants in material transformation are fuel, air, oil, and water. The coolant pump of a motor, for instance, serves as a main function of transporting cooling medium (material transformation by position change, Fig. 4), which is equally applicable to the fan, which transports air for cooling or supports the transport of air during driving through position change (Fig. 4). Additionally, information conversion represents the transformation and/or transmission of information quantities, such as physical quantities like temperature, airflow rate, speed, etc., which in the combustion engine encompasses data that is required for its operation, including data on fuel and air consumption but also on the operating state of the combustion engine, such as engine speed, load state, coolant, and oil temperatures (Fig. 1, p. 16). For example, the temperature of the cooling fluid is sensed by a temperature sensor and provided to the control unit as a voltage signal for fuel injection (see Chap. 56.3.8).

--- Page 9 ---
Fundamentals of the Vehicle System show the energy-, substance-, and information-transformation in the internal combustion engine, where energy is transformed from chemical energy to thermal energy and mechanical energy, substances are transformed, for example, fuel-air mixture, exhaust gases, and cooling air, and information is transformed, for example, fuel and oil quantities into fuel consumption and oil pressure; this occurs through a resistance change of the temperature sensor and the associated voltage change at a measurement resistor in the control unit, which measures the voltage change and determines the engine temperature based on stored values in a characteristic field, processes the determined temperature in the control unit to determine, for example, the injection quantity required at that engine temperature to ensure idle running; thereby, the input signal (resistance change) is processed in the device (information processing) and output as an output signal (injection time) according to the EVA principle, since technical systems always contain information processing (information transformation), and control and regulation devices of an internal combustion engine are information-transformation systems that influence energy and substance transformations intentionally.

The grouping of technical systems according to Fig. 2 shows the overall system vehicle, the subsystem internal combustion engine, the functional group crankshaft mechanism, and the functional element connecting rod; where functions are differentiated into main function, sub-function, and basic functions; technical systems are divided as follows: the overall system is responsible for fulfilling the main function, for example, transporting people and/or goods, the subsystem is responsible for fulfilling a sub-function (see Chapter 3.3.2), for example, the internal combustion engine should convert chemical energy into mechanical energy (Fig. 2, p. 17); the subsystem is an independent usable unit, so that, for example, the internal combustion engine can fulfill its sub-function in different vehicles; the functional group is responsible for fulfilling a basic function (see Chapter 3.3.2), for example, the crankshaft mechanism of the internal combustion engine should convert the reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion of the crankshaft; the functional group is not an independent usable unit of a subsystem; the functional element is the smallest indivisible unit of a functional group, for example, crankshaft, connecting rod, piston, piston pin, bearing shells; also, the functional element has a basic function to fulfill, for example, the connecting rod should transmit the force from the piston, which arises from combustion pressure, to the crankshaft; the grouping of technical systems facilitates understanding individual elements of the overall system, analysis, and troubleshooting; what is considered as overall system or subsystem depends on the observer, for the manufacturer of a vehicle, the vehicle is the overall system and, for example, the engine is a subsystem, while an engine manufacturer would consider the engine as the overall system and, for example, the injection system as a subsystem.

The illustration 3 shows subsystems of the vehicle, including the drive unit, such as the internal combustion engine, the energy transmission unit, such as the gearbox, the support and suspension unit, such as the wheel suspension, the control unit, such as ABS, and the work unit, such as the driven wheels. The work unit is the subsystem that directly fulfills a main function, where the work unit of the vehicle is the connection between the driven wheels and the road, through which people and goods are transported (fulfillment of the main function), with partial functions and basic functions of the vehicle being considered, for example, the drive train of a vehicle as a whole system, comprising motor, clutch, gearbox, etc., each subsystem taking on a specific partial function (Fig. 4), every partial function being built from multiple basic functions, and technical systems cannot be further divided into functions, such as the piston of the internal combustion engine converting chemical energy into mechanical energy, where the motor converts energy, the gearbox converts rotational speed and torque, the driveshaft transmits rotational speeds and torques, and the driven wheel transmits rotational speeds and torques.

Every vehicle possesses the following subsystems: drive unit, such as internal combustion engine, energy transmission unit, such as gearbox, support and suspension unit, such as wheel suspension, control unit, such as ABS, and work unit, such as driven wheels. The drive unit converts the input energy into the required driving energy and in the vehicle, through the motor (drive unit), chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy (Fig. 2, p. 17). The energy transmission unit guides the energy in the required movement and speed to the driven wheels, with the transmission of the motor's mechanical energy occurring over the drive train (energy transmission unit).

The support and suspension unit is the frame or self-supporting structure, primarily tasked with accepting subsystems and connecting them into a unity. The control unit influences the substance and energy conversion through information processing, where multiple control units are present in the vehicle, such as steering, braking, fuel injection, ignition, and exhaust systems.

The tasks include: What are technical systems and how do they get their designation?, Name five examples of technical systems of the vehicle, Name three implementation forms (main functions) of technical systems, Describe the substance conversion of a coolant pump, Name three subsystems of the vehicle, Name five typical partial functions of technical systems, What is the task of the energy transmission unit, What is the task of the support and suspension unit, What do all basic functions have in common, and from which functions is a partial function built?
